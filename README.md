This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input parameters.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.  This example focuses on handling invalid user IDs passed as route parameters but the concept extends to other scenarios.  Always validate inputs and handle potential errors gracefully to prevent application crashes and improve robustness.
